            <h4>What is SOLID?</h4>
            <div class="col-8">
                <p>SOLID is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design (OOD) principles by Robert C. Martin
                    (also known as Uncle Bob).These principles establish practices that lend to developing software with
                    considerations for maintaining and extending as the project grows. Adopting these practices can also
                    contribute to avoiding code smells, refactoring code, and Agile or Adaptive software
                    development.SOLID stands for:<br>1. S - Single-responsiblity Principle <br> 2. O - Open-closed
                    Principle <br> 3. L - Liskov Substitution Principle <br> 4. I - Interface Segregation Principle <br>
                    5. D - Dependency Inversion Principle</p>

            <h4>Single-Responsibility Principle</h4>
            <div class="col-8">
                <p>Single-responsibility Principle (SRP) states that a class should have one and only one reason to
                    change, meaning that a class should have only one job.</p>
                <p>E.g:- The create() method is a factory method whose purpose is to only create a tuple list.</p>

                <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/srp.png') }}" height="200px"
                     class="d-block w-100"
                     alt="...">

        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <h4>Open-Closed Principle</h4>
            <div class="col-8">
                <p>Open-Closed Principle(OCP) states that Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed
                    for modification. This means that a class should be extendable without modifying the class
                    itself.</p>
                <p>E.g:- The convert_args_to_tuple_of_float() method declares variable list_value_float which can be
                    used by addition,multiplication and subtraction classes.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-4">
                <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/ocp.png') }}" height="200px"
                     class="d-block w-100"
                     alt="...">
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <h4>Liskov Substitution Principle</h4>
            <div class="col-8">
                <p>Liskov Substitution Principle states that Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type
                    T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T. This means that
                    every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class.</p>
                <p>E.g:- In this image we can see variables are not changed in both "calculation" class (parent class)
                    and "subtraction" (child class) making them reusable in other classes</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-4">
                <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/lsp.png') }}" height="200px"

        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <h4>Interface Segregation Principle</h4>
            <div class="col-8">
                <p>Interface Segregation Principle states that A client should never be forced to implement an interface
                    that it doesn’t use, or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.</p>
                <p>As classes should do one and only one thing interfaces should also do one and only one thing</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-4">
                <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/srp.png') }}" height="200px"
                     class="d-block w-100"

        <div class="row">
            <h4>Dependency Inversion Principle</h4>
            <div class="col-8">
                <p>Dependency Inversion Principle states that Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions.
                    It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend
                    on abstractions.</p>
