                <p>
                    Encapsulation in Python describes the concept of bundling data and methods within a single unit. So,
                    for example, when you create a class, it means you are implementing encapsulation. A class is an
                    example of encapsulation as it binds all the data members (instance variables) and methods into a
                    single unit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the given image we can see Addition instance that is stored inside the calculation variable
                    encapsulates the data and the functionality to work on the data to perform get result calculation
                </p>

            <h4>Abstraction</h4>
            <div class="col-8">
                <p>Abstraction is used to hide the internal functionality of the function from the users. The users only
                    interact with the basic implementation of the function, but inner working is hidden. User is
                    familiar with that "what function does" but they don't know "how it does."
                    In simple words, we all use the smartphone and very much familiar with its functions such as camera,
                    voice-recorder, call-dialing, etc., but we don't know how these operations are happening in the
                    background. Let's take another example - When we use the TV remote to increase the volume. We don't
                    know how pressing a key increases the volume of the TV. We only know to press the "+" button to
                    increase the volume.</p>
                <p>As we can see get_result is not preforming directly addition function while it is simply calling a
                    loop and then within the loop there is add function, so this is basically abstracting the process of
                    doing the addition on a list of numbers. We have one function which is a loop while we have another
                    function which is add in order to have result of the list we need to have both </p>

            <h4>Inheritance</h4>
            <div class="col-8">
                <p>Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class.
                    The benefits of inheritance are:


                    It represents real-world relationships well.
                    It provides reusability of a code. We donâ€™t have to write the same code again and again. Also, it
                    allows us to add more features to a class without modifying it.
                    It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from another class A, then all the
                    subclasses of B would automatically inherit from class A.</p>
                <p> As we can see from the image that abstract class Calculation which is the base for addition,
                    subtraction, multiplication. It allows all the subclasses to inherit the capabilities of its parent
                    class which is Calculator</p>

            <div class="col-4">
                <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/inheritance.png') }}" height="300px"
                     class="d-block w-100"

            <h4>Polymorphism</h4>
            <div class="col-8">
                <p>Polymorphism means having vivid or different forms. In the programming world, Polymorphism refers to
                    the ability of the function with the same name to carry different functionality altogether. It
                    creates a structure that can use many forms of objects.
                    This permits functions/arguments to use entities of different types at different times.
                    In object-oriented programming, Polymorphism allows a particular object referring to a particular
                    class to be used in a similar fashion as if it was a different object referring to altogether a
                    different class.</p>
                <p>Python can use different types of classes, in the same way, using Polymorphism. To serve this
                    purpose, one can create a loop that iterates through a tuple of objects. Post which, one can call
                    the methods without having a look at the type of class to which the object belongs to.</p>
                <p>If we observe the above figure get_result() which is class calculations method is inherited by the
                    child classes addition and multiplication, and they implement the same method in different ways they
                    are overriding the methods and using them in their way. Class "addition" is returning the added
                    result and class "multiplication" is returning the multiplied result</p>
