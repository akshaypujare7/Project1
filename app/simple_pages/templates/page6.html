    <h1>AAA testing</h1>

    <h4>What is AAA testing?</h4>
    <p>Arrange-Act-Assert is a great way to structure test cases. It prescribes an order of operations:</p>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-8">
                <p>1. Arrange inputs and targets. Arrange steps should set up the test case. Does the test require any
                    objects or special settings? Does it need to prep a database? Does it need to log into a web app?
                    Handle all of these operations at the start of the test.</p>
                <p>2. Act on the target behavior. Act steps should cover the main thing to be tested. This could be
                    calling a function or method, calling a REST API, or interacting with a web page. Keep actions
                    focused on the target behavior.</p>
                <p>3. Assert expected outcomes. Act steps should elicit some sort of response. Assert steps verify the
                    goodness or badness of that response. Sometimes, assertions are as simple as checking numeric or
                    string values. Other times, they may require checking multiple facets of a system. Assertions will
                    ultimately determine if the test passes or fails.</p>

                <h4>Importance & Benefits of AAA testing</h4>
                <p>There are many reasons that make software testing important:

                    Software testing is essential to notice the defects and errors which may occur during the
                    development phases.
                    Software testing is important since it verifies the customerâ€™s reliability and their content with
                    application.
                    The software testing is very important to test the quality of the product and the good quality
                    product supplied to their customer helps to gain the confidence.
                    Testing is necessary when you give the facilities to the customers like delivery of high quality
                    product or software application which requires minimal maintenance cost and gives good results and
                    precise results.
                    Software testing has to be carried out because it gives effective performance of the software
                    application.
                    It makes sure that the application should not result into any failures because it may lead into
                    extra expenses.
                    It is necessary to stay in the business.</p>
                <p>There are many benefits of AAA in unit testing, but the main one is that it saves time.

                    It saves time because it helps developers write a test without thinking about how to structure the
                    unit test method. With AAA, developers just follow the instructions that are provided to them.

                    In addition, you can use AAA for a variety of types of testing, including integration testing,
                    system testing, and acceptance testing.</p>

                <p>Here if we see in the given image we can see AAA testing, this image is taken from calculator
                    project. First is declaring variables using constructors so that same variables can be used multiple
                    times second is performing the action to be taken according to the class i.e addition class is
                    performing addition action. Third is asserting values and checking whether the action is correct or
                    wrong</p>
